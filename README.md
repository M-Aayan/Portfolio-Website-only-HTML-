# Portfolio-Website-only-HTML-
This repository contains my personal portfolio built using only HTML. It showcases my journey as a UI/UX designer, featuring my work and projects. The portfolio demonstrates my design skills and the use of basic HTML to structure content. Future updates will incorporate additional front-end technologies as I continue learning.
